      In any discussion on how to improve your programming skills, one book gets more recommendations
      than any other: <em>The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em> (SICP) by
      Abelson and Sussman. SICP was the introductory computer science text at MIT for many years. But
      how much could a professional developer really learn from a first year CS book?
    </p>
    <p>
      Last fall I embarked on an adventure and invited folks to join me in a weekly study of SICP. We
      worked the examples and compared our answers. I am here today to share what mind-blowing
      concepts we discovered in just the first two chapters of SICP. Expect to see some Ruby code
      like you've never seen before.

      We've all learned that writing tests before code is a great way to develop software. It turns out that it's
      also a great way to learn how to develop software in the first place! In this talk we discuss a number of
      projects that have used test-first approaches to teach Ruby, including Ruby Koans, RailsBridge Workshops,
      Wolfram Arnold's BFT (behavior-first teaching), Blazing Cloud JavaScript and Rails classes, plus our own
      open-source Learn Ruby TFT (test-first teaching) curriculum (at

      Back in the old days, you submitted a form to some URL and you got
      back some HTML. These days, you probably didn't hit submit, your URL
      probably didn't change, and what you got back was probably JSON&mdash;but
      you never saw it because it came in asynchronously in the background.
      Best practices around web applications are changing fast, driven by
      new browser standards, sophisticated JavaScript libraries and super
      fast JavaScript implementations. Why would a web framework design from
      2004 still be appropriate? What can we be doing to adapt, or reinvent,
      our approaches to building web apps?

    <p>
      Machine learning is a discipline that is concerned with the design and development of
      algorithms that allow computers to evolve behaviors based on empirical data &mdash; a fancy
      name for a simple concept. Behind all the buzzword algorithms such as Decision Trees,
      Singular Value Decomposition, Bayes and Support Vector Machines lie the simple observations
      and principles that make them tick. In this presentation, we will take a
      ground-up look at how they work (in practical terms), why they work, and how you can
      apply them in Ruby for fun and profit.
    </p>
    <p>
      No prior knowledge required. We will take a quick look at the foundations (representing and
      modeling knowledge, compression, and inference), and build up to simple but powerful
      examples such as clustering, recommendations, and classification &mdash; all in 30 minutes
      or less, believe it or not.

      Arel (also known as ActiveRelation) is the Ruby relational algebra
      engine powering ActiveRecord in Rails 3. By replacing string
      concatenation with an object model to express SQL queries, Arel had a
      big immediate impact on the ActiveRecord codebase and opens the door
      for more powerful Object Relation Mapping (ORM) functionality in the
      future. This talk will introduce the concept of relational algebra,
      cover the past, present and future of Arel, and dive into how you can
      leverage it today either on its own, or in your Rails 3 applications.

    <p class="speaker"><a href="speakers.html#hendrickson">Elisabeth Hendrickson</a></p>
    <p>
      Modern acceptance testing frameworks like Cucumber express tests in natural language, enabling
      organizations to establish their own Domain Specific Languages (DSLs). This powerful capability is a
      huge boon for communication: technical team members and non-technical business stakeholders can use
      the same vocabulary in expressing both requirements and tests. However, just creating a DSL does not
      ensure we will write good, clear tests. Indeed, it is all too easy to create acceptance tests that
      contain so many extraneous details that the real intentions behind the tests are obfuscated. In this
      session, Elisabeth will demonstrate how to edit technically correct but verbose Cucumber tests to
      increase clarity, reduce extraneous distracting details, and improve maintainability. Along the way
      we'll see how paying attention to the advice in <em>Elements of Style</em> applies to writing better
      automated acceptance tests. Strunk and White would be proud.

      Are you confident that your code works the way you expect? Is it easy
      to change? Do you get accurate feedback when you do change it? If the
      answer to any of these questions is no, the problem is not your code:
      it's your tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      We'll look at the state-of-the-art Ruby testing libraries and
      frameworks to start you off with an effective testing toolset. In
      addition to the toolset, we'll also explore the testing mindset.
      Should I mock this or stub it? Should I write a unit test or an
      integration test? How do I write tests that allow me to refactor with
      confidence? If you've ever asked yourself questions like these, this
      session is for you.

    <p>
      Rails 3 has added quite a number of new ways to extend the framework. These include
      swapping in a new ORM that still works cleanly with ActionPack, a brand new instrumentation
      system, and ways to build custom controllers, mixing and matching the pieces that you
      want. In this talk, Yehuda will give an overview of these new systems, and show some real-world
      examples of using them in plugins and in your application itself.

      He will also talk about how to think about using the new Rails architecture to streamline your
      stack for performance-critical parts of your app, without losing the integration you've
      come to expect or the features you absolutely need in those cases.</p>

    <p>
      The Rails revolution, and Ruby along with it, began in the loud public echosphere of startup
      companies. The arrival of the Rails framework and the "Web 2.0" explosion created a very thunderous
      effect. Magazine after magazine reported on Rails. All the hip, funded and loud startups were using
      Rails to build their wares. It became a thing that VCs would assume you were using, and if not,
      why? The first RailsConf was 90% attended by startups. Rails was a revolution. Since then the
      loudness has waned. Is the revolution over? Is Rails done? Au contraire, the revolution has gone
      underground. It's penetrating places that Twitter does not hear. It's building things that are not
      reported. It's entered the enterprise. This talk will document the rise of Rails and glorious
      revolution which we barely see, but is happening every day.

      cream on apple pie. As a close second place, Bryan will show you why you need to at least investigate
      ActiveModel for your current or next project. Of course there will be tests, code, and more tests at Bryan's
      ActiveModel Extravaganza.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this session, I will discuss why ActiveModel could be a great interface to allow Rails to get access to your
      data on your own terms. I'll start from the beginning, and using TDD, I'll explore the interfaces Rails 3
      exposes in their API. Next, I'll explore the components of ActiveModel. Finally, I'll show you how I'm using
      ActiveModel right <em>now</em>, and give you a real-world war report. I repeat: There will be code.

      RSpec has been in major rewrite mode for the past 6 months, and with the recent release of Rails 3,

      RSpec's new metadata that allows you to really fine-tune your test suite.

    <p class="speaker"><a href="speakers.html#mei">Sarah Mei</a></p>
    <p>
      I secretly think that NoSQL data stores are rabbits. They're breeding
      under the floorboards when we're asleep. How else do you explain a
      landscape that includes Redis, Riak, CouchDB, Tokyo Cabinet, Flock,
      MongoDB, and Cassandra, among many others? Mopsy and Cottontail can't
      be far behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Given this, picking the right rab&hellip; er, data store for your project can
      be a challenge. There are lots of factors to consider, such as tail
      fluffiness, consistency guarantees, replication strategies, and ear length.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Ruby API for the data store is important too. That's what
      you'll be dealing with day in and day out once you make your choice.
      If you can't stand the interface, you'll get sick of cleaning the cage
      pretty quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this talk, I'll run you through the mechanics of accessing several
      NoSQL data stores with Ruby. I promise not to bring a rabbit to the
      conference, and I definitely won't bring two. The last thing we need
      is more.

    <p>
      A radically new relationship between developers and our government is taking shape. All levels of
      government&mdash;federal agencies, states, and cities&mdash;have begun opening their vast troves of data to
      citizens, free of charge and license.
    </p>
    <p>
      It started small, but as inspired citizens, including many Ruby developers, have taken government data and
      created awesome apps, more and more governments have taken the leap to give their data away. Some have even
      started collaborating with citizens and creating new government services that never existed before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a historic and powerful opportunity for us as Ruby developers, and we need to take advantage of it. This

      JavaScript.  Technologies are designed to take on problems of a specific nature.
      There are those that are great for systems work and those that are not.  Some make
      generating reports a cinch.  A few are remarkable at digging through data.
      Networking can be a nightmare in some.  I'll start with a swift but gentle introduction
      to Ruby's good but not great suits and move us into what to replace them with.

    <p>
      As soon as you have your first contributor you have to begin to think about how to manage not just the code
      but also the people. There are no org charts or managers to lean on for assistance; you have to figure out
      how to keep your contributors happy and on the right path. The tone you set for your project early on will
      stick with it for a very long time, so it's important to be sure you're the one setting it rather than
      allowing it to happen outside your control.

    <p>
      The Unix shell is widely despised as a modern programming language due to its
      arcane syntax, unpredictable control flow, and lack of support for fundamental
      constructs like: exception handling, objects, a module system, string functions,
      or even local variables! It's old. There are a billion implementations of the core
      language and userland utilities, each with subtle and incompatible differences.
      Documentation is too sparse or too dense or available only at your local
      library. It's a minefield.
    </p>
    <p>
      But for all its perceived flaws, the Unix shell can be an amazingly productive
      environment&mdash;once you learn to hate it properly. It has super powers. Stuff
      you won't find in more general purpose languages. Learn to harness the shell's
      AWESOME POWER and you'll be able to quickly automate a wide range of tasks
      related to development workflow, source code editing, and systems administration/analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this talk, I want to show how to navigate the minefield, how to "think in
