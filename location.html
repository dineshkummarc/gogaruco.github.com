  <h2>Lodging</h2>
  <p>If you're looking for a place to stay, you might try one of these hotels listed here.  There
    aren't any good places to stay near the conference center, so we recommend staying in the Union
    Square / Downtown area.  It's easy to take MUNI to the conference from any of the Market
    Street subway stations.</p>
  <p>GoGaRuCo has no official connection to any of these hotels, and there is no conference rate being
    offered. We're just providing this list as a convenience to help visitors.</p>
