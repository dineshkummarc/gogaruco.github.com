      <h3><a name="liles"></a>Bryan Liles</h3>
      <p>Bryan does a myriad of Ruby related tasks for his daytime job in a quaint little town near Baltimore, Maryland.
        He hasn't written any books, and doesn't maintain any major open source projects. Most of his time  is spent
        helping others level up their awesomeness; trying to cause chaos with writings on
        <a href="http://smartic.us">his blog</a>; or just being a great dad and husband. Some came to lead.  Some come
        to be lead.  Bryan comes to smash the status quo.</p>
