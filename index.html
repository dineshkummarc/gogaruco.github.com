    <h3>New Location and Dates Announced</h3>
    <p class="date">Posted July 5, 2010</p>
    <p>After last year's smashing success, we knew it was time to grow! After a long and
      arduous search, we've got our new dates and venue all settled up: we'll be at the beautiful
      <a href="/location.html">Mission Bay Conference Center at UCSF</a> on September 17 and 18. The facilities
      are state of the art with plentiful power and comfortable seating, the location is just a short MUNI ride
      from downtown, and it can accommodate a bigger batch of attendees.</p>
